balmy breeze
whitecaps on the bay
drifting fog
frost lingers
boat house
the small cabin
summer's day
on the jetty
spring morning
spring dusk
dance studio
my ear conch
sunny noon
i draw the snow
winter zoo
leaving home
another glass of champagne
cluster of juncos
twist of dust
dry leaves
overgrown path
textured light
rainy spring
folded poppies
a butterfly's
approaching dusk
spring mist
christmas long gone
one mosquito
goldenrod
smoky amber beads
still carrying
sudden thunder
lingering daylight
heavy snowfall
the languages
first light
winter solstice
drifting clouds
winter sun
high speed train
home town
looking at you
silent hour
two voids
new year's eve
soul searching
morning chill
sandhill cranes
cutting me off
white on white
morning sun
stiff fingers
past midnight
the smell of horses
wild cleft
receding whistle
distant thunder
first oriole
my son skips
happy hour
a moving van
flickering street light
the conversation
morning frost
open sky
first frost
first snow
home city
night cafe
leaf descent
eh to zed
richard iii reburied
evening rush hour
garden reading
drizzling ash
cold night
a mouse click
twilight
spider's web
spring
lagoon at sunrise
dawn hike
sunrise
father's day
absently choking
whistling kettle 
kernels of rain
snow's sharp slant
global warming
that foghorn bawl
spring planting
may drizzle 
deer fencing
summer cabin
preceded
salamander rain
mountain road
prairie stop
windfall apples
sky puffy
third anniversary
starry night
no moonlight
barren trees
summer beach
winter snow
dawn thunder
day's end
the morning after
new town
spray art
winter's end
flight of fireflies
store window mannequins
garden party
random rain splatters
miles of nothingness
puffs of clouds
starlight
approaching
the feast
winter hike
fly fishing
living dangerously
autumn dusk
in the company
salt marsh
spring rain 
the song
after curfew 
fresh snow 
spring hike
fireplace logs
arrows of geese
last year's grass 
over snow
yukon hike
the smack of sandals
lone yellow flower
at the tulip festival
campsite with the view
break in the showers
so much to say
winter again
many more rounds
ghost town
autumn sky
late evening 
winter solstice 
station emptying
melting snow
a day of rain
first day of spring
blue sky morning
mourning
summer shade
off grid
still life lilies
the street artist
longing for spring
tracking your path
ocean swim
toy dump truck
yukon forest
the crosswalk sign
high tide
flies circle the room
evening mist
stranded
golden thaw
adding wings
year's end
garden walk
air hostess
december
forked road
spring again 
wet asphalt 
thinning crowds
footpath closed
another year
war news
spring dawn
driving over gravel
souvenir t shirts
rolling thunder
spring cleaning
back to routine
winter drizzle
stocking
the busker
night train
half bloomed rose
pattern of her
tipsy night
after the rain
meditation hour
waking me up
over tea
autumn's last month
a line of gulls
slap bang
holding onto summer
the whole field
leaves falling
well being
pausing to ponder
beach volleyball
the wasp
block of flats
all night drive
ice in the driveway
unkindness of ravens
cars drive by
tax time
gusts of wind
rose garden
monsoon sky
garden buddha
a whiff of jasmine
monsoon lull
blackout
sunflowers 
crimson leaves 
jamun tree 
long afternoon
all that remains
a better day
water
wine tasting
rusted mailbox
willow grove
in the art supply drawer
contract signed
tanned knees
in the country road ditch
no temple bell
doughnuts for dessert
schoolyard 
clown car 
log cabin window 
art festival
even the leaves
alpine nightfall 
river eddy
arctic sun
